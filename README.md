# 3GL-Help

3GL Help is a personal project that acts as a platform aims to help both new and experienced programmers to share interesting code snippets, projects, or tips and tricks to enhance their learning, revision, improvement, and optimization of their skills.

3GLs, or third-generation programming languages, refer to high-level programming languages such as those listed in the repository. These are the most common programming languages that virtually every programmer learns as an entry point and often continues to use throughout their life or career.
