# Python
Python is easy to run, because it is an interpreted language, it doesn't require any sort of code compilation in order to execute Python programs or scripts.

## Installation
The most braindead way to install Python is through their [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Version Control
[Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/) is my personal favourite way to use Python, as well as to version control. Once miniconda is installed, I can simply create a new python environment with any version I like, for example:
```conda create -n openvino_env python=3.7```

Once created make sure to select (or "activate" as it called) ```conda activate openvino_env``` before you start doing any changes in the same session.

This was taken directly from [openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/wiki/Conda)

I personally haven't tried it myself but I am aware Python of [pyenv](https://pyenv-win.github.io/pyenv-win/) in order to manage python versions.
